\begin{problem}{5.33}
Consider the problem of determining whether a PDA accepts some string of the
form $\{ww \ | \ w \in \{0,1\}^{*}\}$. Use the computation history method to show that this problem is undecidable.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
Let $B = \{\langle P \rangle \ | \ P \text{ is a PDA that accepts some string of the form } \{ww \ | \ w \in \{0,1\}^{*}\}$. This proof is by contradiction. To get the contradiction, we assume that $B$ is decidable and use this assumption to show that $A_{TM}$ is decidable. \\

Follow the construction given in Theorem 5.13 to construct a CFG $G$ that generates all strings that are not accepting computation histories for $M$ on $w$.



We use the construction given in Theorem 5.13 to construct a PDA $D$

This proof is similar to that of Theorem 5.10 but with a small extra twist: It is a
reduction from ATM via computation histories, but we modify the representation
of the computation histories slightly for a technical reason that we will explain
later.
\end{proof}
