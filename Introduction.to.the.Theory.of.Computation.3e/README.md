## To Do

- [ ] Chapter name is misspelled
- [ ] Problem 1.38 - redo the proof (all-NFA)
- [ ] Problem 1.43 - proof by construction
- [ ] Problem 1.45 - revise and typeset (A/B)
- [ ] Problem 1.49 - part (a) requires more work and typeset
- [ ] Problem 1.51 - part (3) same dummy variable (z) is used twice in application of the definition, better use different variables and then show that dummy renaming is possible..?
- [ ] Problem 1.56

- [ ] Problem 1.59
- [ ] Problem 1.60 - typeset
- [ ] Problem 1.61 - typeset
- [ ] Problem 1.62 - write formal proof from proof idea and typeset
- [ ] Problem 1.63 - write formal proof from proof idea and typeset
- [ ] Problem 1.64
- [ ] Problem 1.65 - part (b)
- [ ] Problem 1.66 - part (a) proof by construction
- [ ] Problem 1.68 - part (b)
- [ ] Problem 1.69

### In Progress

- [ ] Problem 1.57 - write formal proof from proof idea and typeset
